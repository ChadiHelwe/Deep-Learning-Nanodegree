# Deep Learning Nanodegree

According to Udacity, a Nanodegree is a project and skills-based educational credential program. You enroll, you learn a suite of skills, you successfully complete a certain amount of projects that demonstrate your mastery of these skills, and you receive a credential affirming your mastery of these skills.

At this repo, I have organized my class materials and my projects in Deep Learning Nanodegree.

# Projects

1 - [My first neural network](1-Neural-Net-Intro/Project-1/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb) - Using only Numpy I have builded and trained a neural network to predict the number of shared bike users.

2 - [Image classification](2-Image-Classification/Project-2/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb) - Using Tensorflow to build a CNN and classify Cifar-10 images. This project have a [live demo](https://github.com/rafaelnovello/cifar-10-demo)

3 - [Generating TV scripts](3-Recurrent-NN/Project-3/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb) - Using Tensorflow to build a RNN and generate entirely new pieces of Simpsons dialogs.

4 - [English to French Translation](3-Recurrent-NN/Project-4/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb) - Translating English to French with RNN. This project have a [live demo](https://github.com/rafaelnovello/translator-demo)

5 - [Faces generation](4-Generative-Adversarial-Net/Project-5/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb) - With generative adversarial net builded with Tensorflow, I created new faces. This project don't have live demo, but you can see the results in [a gif here](4-Generative-Adversarial-Net/Project-5/GAN-faces.gif)

Extra - [Hand digit recognition](https://github.com/rafaelnovello/mnist-demo/blob/master/Categoring%20and%20Optimizing%20MNIST%20model.ipynb) - It isn't a nanodegree project, It's just a normal class but I have build a [live demo for it.](https://github.com/rafaelnovello/mnist-demo)
